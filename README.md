# Minesweeper
A (not really) reimagining of a classic

I won't hide it - I like Minesweeper. It's a simple, fun game of logic. So, when I was looking for more project ideas and got the suggestion to remake Minesweeper, I had to do it. 

Challenges here for me were trying to keep track of everything (bombs, neighbours etc.) and handling lots of strange bugs. I found using objects to be very useful here and they saved me a lot of pain for sure. The mechanic for revealing multiple tiles at once (when you click on a zero tile, the other non-bomb tiles around it should be revealed) was not so easy to figure out either, but I managed to employ some recursion there.

It was definitely not easy, but it's really fun and satisfying to see my (limited) knowledge create a real, tangible game!
